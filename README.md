# Datapackage for modelling 100% RE in South East Asia

* country codes: VN, MM, KH, LA, TH A
* all power / energy units are in MW / MWh. 



## Improvements

* Hydro representation with seasonal profile
* Consider rising costs for growing exploitation of hydro potential (e.g. by different components)
* Max installed capacity (max potential of all energy sources)
* Transmission representation
* Consider other technologies
* ...
